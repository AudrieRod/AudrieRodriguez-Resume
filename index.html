        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My pronouns are She/her. I am a second year at the University of California Riverside. I am a pre-business major that would like to focus on business administration once I get into the school of business at UCR. My dream is to one day become an entrepreneur. I knew that I wanted to be an entrepreneur because I was inspired when I took my first business class in high school. We once saw a movie on how Mc Dondalds came to be a franchise and I was inspired by the Mc Donald brothers. Even though they were cheated out the company in the end, they inspired me because they had a love for their business.They were already successful in their own way before it became a franchise and Dream that I can have that one day. For now, I am looking for new opportunities so I can continue to be inspired. Hopefully I will develop my own idea and inspiration for my future business. Before this, I had no idea what I wanted to be or do. I once wanted to work in animation but changed my mind after this business class. So I decided to choose Business administration for my major. I have also planned on minoring in business finance so I can have more opportunities and will be able to do basic accounting. I think this will be an asset for the companies I work for in the future. <br><br>

        As for work experience, I have done my part in food service. My first job was at The Habit Burger Grill in which I learned how to interact with customers and my fellow coworkers. My second job was at Wienerschnitzel where I expanded in my knowledge of food service. I also learned new things like learning how to work drive through. My third and current job is working for Wetzel's Pretzels. All food service jobs require the same levels of understanding, but with each job I found myself growing with new experiences. One of my dream jobs would have been to work for Barnes and Noble. I think this would be a good opportunity to not only be around what I love but also get the chance to learn more about retail. After all my experiences with being in college and three jobs, I have learned that business is no joke and that there is a lot of hard work that goes into it. This inspires me to learn more and is why I would be a good candidate for the job. <br><br>

        Some fun facts about me are that I like to bake, read, draw, and paint. Overall, I would like to think that I am a very creative person. So not only will I be bringing in knowledge and understanding, but I will be bringing creativity and possible new ideas. I am looking for work that allows me to flourish in terms of my creativity. I also would like to obtain new connections and new growth opportunities.
